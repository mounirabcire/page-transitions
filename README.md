# Page Transitions 

## About This Project 🚀
Exploring various page transition animations! 🌟

## Technologies 🛠️
- `tailwindcss`
- `React`
- `Framer Motion`

## Process 💭
I learned how to make cool page transition animations by watching a tutorial video. Then, I figured out how they work and recreated them based on what I understood.


## Learnings 📚
- **AnimatePresence Component:** By using the AnimatePresence component from Framer Motion, you can animate components when they enter or exit the DOM. This component facilitates smooth transitions between different states or components in your React application.

- **Utilizing location.pathname for Key Prop**: Setting the key prop of components based on location.pathname in React Router allows for efficient re-rendering of components when the URL path changes. This technique ensures that the AnimatePresence component is triggered appropriately, enabling seamless animations during navigation transitions
